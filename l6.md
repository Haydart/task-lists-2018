# LSDP - Task list 6

## Actors in Go
### Tech:

* [Go lang](https://golang.org/)
* [Protoactors](https://github.com/AsynkronIT/protoactor-go)

### Tasks

0. Play with example Go project


	* build project:
        ```bash
            vagrant up
            vagrant ssh
            cd ~/go/src/example
            go get -v ./
            go build
        ```
	* run:
        ```bash
            vagrant up
            vagrant ssh
            cd ~/go/src/example
            ./example
        ```


1. Create  (copy example with different name) project for merge sorting using actor

2. Create supervisor actor that will:
    * can be configured in terms of parallelism
    * receive input for sorting
    * split input to k parts (slice)
    * distribute parts using round robin router (API) to n (parallelism, might not be equal to k) actors
    * receive resutls and merg sort them
    * how to merge sort? use state machines (or any other approach):
        * start sorting, change state remembering pid of sorting message sender
        * change state after receiving first sort result to state that contains result
        * in new state, whe receive new result, change state again but merge results
        * after receiving all required results, return result to actor that sent us sorting request

3. Create sorting actor (supervised by actor from 2)

    * receive array for sorting
    * sort the array (any method, builtin)
    * respond with result

4. Create program that:

    * takes n, k parameters
    * takes p (length of array) parameter
    * generates p length array with random numbers
    * creates supervisor actor
    * asks (request response) supervisor for sorted array


5. Measure execution times :

    * evaluate n, k, p parameters
    * evaluate edge cases (one big chunk for sorting, a lot of small chunks)
    * HOW TO MEASURE TIME?

6. Create summary report (any format):
    * execution time tables
    * execution time plots


7. EXTRA 10 POINTS:

    * use remoting/cluster
    * create needed protobuf definitions for messages
    * using remoting:

        * start each sorting actor on separate port

    * evaluate times using same approach as in point 5
